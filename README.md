# Introduction

This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs that demonstrate the use of arrays. The programs are written in C++ and have only been tested on Windows.

The programs cover a variety of topics, including:

Creating and printing arrays 

* Accessing elements of arrays to find the maximum and minimum integer

* Searching and sorting arrays 

* Analyzing the performance of array operations 

* Using arrays to solve problems 

* The programs are well-commented and easy to understand. They can be used as a learning resource for students and programmers who are interested in learning about arrays in C++.

# How to use

To run the programs, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can then open the programs in a C++ IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.

The level of difficulty of the programs is basic. They are suitable for people who are new to C++ or arrays.
