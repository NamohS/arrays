#Introduction

This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs that demonstrate the use of arrays. The programs are written in C++ and have only been tested on Windows.

The programs cover a variety of topics, including:

*Creating and printing arrays [Output snap of create_array.cpp]
*Accessing elements of arrays to find the maximum and minimum integer [Output snap of access_array.cpp]
*Searching and sorting arrays [Output snap of sort_array.cpp]
*Analyzing the performance of array operations [Output snap of analyze_array.cpp]
*Using arrays to solve problems [Output snap of solve_problem.cpp]
*The programs are well-commented and easy to understand. They can be used as a learning resource for students and programmers who are interested in learning about arrays in C++.

How to use

To run the programs, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can then open the programs in a C++ IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.

The level of difficulty of the programs is basic. They are suitable for students who are new to C++ or arrays.
